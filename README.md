## About

Engine2 is a game engine built on [The Forge](https://github.com/ConfettiFX/The-Forge) rendering API as a personal playground for building up an engine from an existing engine framework. The goal of this project is to have a "batterys included" approach to a minimal engine.



## Requirements

- Visual Studio 2019

## Building

```bash
# Clone with submodules
git clone --recursive https://github.com/brandonchui/Engine2

# Open Engine.sln in Visual Studio
# Set Pong as startup project and build
```

## Examples
Includes some example games using the engine minimally.
